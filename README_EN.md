> Tachistoscopic application for enhancing reading skills through saccadic eye movement training

[🇮🇹 Italiano](README.md) | [🇬🇧 English](README_EN.md)

## 📋 Description

**Tachistostory** is an innovative clinical-educational tool designed to enhance children's reading skills through tachistoscopic technique. The application is based on solid neuroscientific principles regarding saccadic eye movements during reading.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Presenting words or short strings for very brief intervals (100–250 ms) in controlled screen positions trains the visual-attentional systems that support saccades and fixations during reading (Bakker & Vinke, 1985; Lorusso et al., 2005).
- This type of training, both in clinical format (VHSS, Tachidino) and in game format (Tachistoscope), is associated with significant improvements in reading speed and accuracy in children with dyslexia and is maintained over time (Lorusso et al., 2022; Piazzalunga et al., 2023; McHolm, 2023).
- In individuals with ADHD, reading modalities that reduce or eliminate eye movements (e.g., RSVP) improve text comprehension compared to traditional reading, indicating that rapid and centered word presentation can compensate for part of the attentional difficulties (Moussaoui et al., 2023), and that tachistoscopic treatments for dyslexia remain effective even in the presence of ADHD (Lorusso et al., 2024).

An app like **Tachistostory**, which presents words for very brief intervals within a game/exercise structure, is therefore part of a tradition of *evidence-based* interventions: it leverages the same principles of tachistoscopic presentation and training of processing during fixations that have been documented as useful for improving reading fluency in dyslexia and, potentially, for supporting readers with ADHD.

### How It Works

The tachistoscope presents single words for brief, controlled periods of time, training the visual system to process written information more efficiently. The training follows a gradual path:

- **Start**: Words are presented for **1200 ms** (comfortable time for struggling readers)
- **Progression**: With consistent exercise, exposure time is progressively reduced
- **Goal**: Reach **220-250 ms**, the natural time of a saccade during fluent reading according to scientific literature

### Clinical Objectives

1. **Reading speed enhancement**: Training of saccadic eye movements
2. **Text comprehension**: Comprehension questions after each sentence to verify processing
3. **Sustained and divided attention**: Maintaining focus during rapid presentation
4. **Working memory**: Word retention to reconstruct sentence meaning

## ✨ Key Features

- 📖 **Tachistoscopic presentation** of single words with configurable times (220-1200 ms)
- 🎯 **Post-stimulus masking** to prevent prolonged processing of retinal image
- 📝 **Content customization**: Load custom texts (`.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`)
- 🎮 **Intuitive interface**: Simple controls suitable for use with children
- 📊 **Progress tracking**: Word-by-word advancement indicator
- 🖥️ **Fullscreen mode**: To eliminate visual distractions
- ⚙️ **Adjustment slider**: Real-time modification of exposure time

## 🎯 Target Audience

### Clinical Professionals
- **Psychologists and neuropsychologists** for cognitive training
- **Speech therapists** for reading rehabilitation
- **Educational psychologists** for educational interventions
- **Developmental neuropsychomotor therapists** for integrated interventions

### Usage Contexts
- Specific Learning Disorders (SLD - Dyslexia)
- Reading skill development delays
- Post-trauma or post-stroke rehabilitation (adults)
- Reading skill enhancement in typical readers

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pygame

### Dependency Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielemaurilli/tachistostory.git

# Enter the directory

```

### requirements.txt File
```
pygame>=2.5.0
docx2txt>=0.8
```

## 💡 Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### Material Preparation

1. **Prepare a text file** (`.txt`, `.doc`, or `.docx`) containing sentences to present
2. **Recommended format**: One sentence per line, with words separated by spaces
3. **Content example**:
   ```
   The cat sleeps on the sofa
   Maria plays ball in the park
   The sun shines in the blue sky
   ```

### Complete Clinical Workflow

1. **Loading**: Drag the file into the application window
2. **Configuration**: Adjust exposure time with slider (start from 1200 ms)
3. **Presentation**: Press ENTER to begin
4. **Reading**: Child reads each word that appears
5. **Reconstruction**: After complete sentence, ask child to reconstruct it
6. **Comprehension**: Ask questions about the read sentence (e.g., "Where was the cat sleeping?")
7. **Progression**: Gradually reduce exposure time in subsequent sessions

### Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| **ENTER** | Start presentation from instruction screen |
| **SPACE** | Move to next word (after mask) |
| **P** | Pause / Resume |
| **R** | Restart from first word |
| **F** | Toggle fullscreen |
| **I** | Minimize window |
| **Slider** | Adjust exposure time (220-1200 ms) |

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

### Saccadic Movements in Reading

During fluent reading, eyes perform rapid movements called **saccades** lasting about **20-40 ms**, followed by fixations of **200-250 ms** during which the brain processes information. Tachistostory trains this natural process.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
### Training Progression

```
Week 1-2:  1200 ms → Tool familiarization
Week 3-4:  900 ms  → First significant reduction
Week 5-6:  600 ms  → Approaching natural time
Week 7-8:  400 ms  → Skill refinement
Week 9+:   250 ms  → Target time for fluent reading
```

*Note: Times are indicative and should be adapted to individual children*

### Trained Cognitive Components

1. **Rapid visual processing**: Immediate word recognition
2. **Working memory**: Maintaining words in memory to reconstruct sentence
3. **Sustained attention**: Maintaining focus during presentation
4. **Divided attention**: Simultaneous management of reading and comprehension
5. **Sequential integration**: Meaning reconstruction from word sequence

## 📖 Clinical Session Example

### Setting
- Duration: 20-30 minutes
- Frequency: 2-3 times per week
- Environment: Quiet, with adequate lighting

### Protocol
1. **Warm-up** (5 min): Comfortable exposure time (e.g., 800 ms)
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. **Training** (10 min): Session target time
=======
2. **Training** (15 min): Session target time
>>>>>>> 1982162 (Initial commit)
3. **Cool-down** (5 min): Comprehension questions and feedback
4. **Recording**: Note time used, number of sentences, errors, perceived fatigue

### Comprehension Questions (Examples)

For sentence: *"The cat sleeps on the sofa"*

- **Literal**: "Who sleeps?" "Where does the cat sleep?"
- **Inferential**: "Do you think it's day or night?" "Is the cat tired?"
- **Memory**: "How many words did the sentence have?" "What was the third word?"

## 🎨 Customization

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
### Creating Custom Materials

Content can be adapted to:
- Child's **reading level**
- **Personal interests** (sports, animals, video games)
- **Specific goals** (new vocabulary, grammatical structures)
- **Curricular themes** (for school support)

>>>>>>> 1982162 (Initial commit)
### Content Suggestions

- Start with short words (3-5 letters)
- Use simple sentences (subject-verb-complement)
- Avoid complex syntactic structures initially
- Gradually increase complexity

## 📊 Progress Monitoring

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
### Indicators to Record
- Exposure time used
